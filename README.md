This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I followed the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and the tutorial to tackle this project as part of the Front end development course. In this project, I learnt the use of Material ui, jquery, ajax fetches and many new dependencies that makes Reacting more efficient.
